## Classification problems

### Overview

We have to find a [[Hypothesis]] h in [[Hypothesis space]] H such that h(x) = c(x) for all x in D.

**Inductive learning hypothesis**: Any hypothesis approximating c over training samples will also approximate c over all samples.

### Find-S algorithm

Definition: Let hj and hk be boolean-valued functions defined over X. Then hj is
moregeneral-than-or-equal-to hk (written hj 2, h k ) if and only if
