## Classification problems

### Overview

We have to find a [[Hypothesis]] h in [[Hypothesis space]] H such that h(x) = c(x) for all x in D.

**Inductive learning hypothesis**: Any hypothesis approximating c over training samples will also approximate c over all samples.

### Find-S algorithm

#### General to specific ordering of hypotheses.

Definition: Let hj and hk be boolean-valued functions defined over X. Then hj is
moregeneral-than-or-equal-to hk (written hj 2, h k ) if and only if

 One way is to begin
with the most specific possible hypothesis in H, then generalize this hypothesis
each time it fails to cover an observed positive training example. (We say that
a hypothesis "covers" a positive example if it correctly classifies the example as
positive.)

This is the
