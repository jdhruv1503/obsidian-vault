## Single-Phase Uncontrolled

### Half-wave

$V_{avg} = \frac{V_{s}}{\pi}$

$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{s}}{2}$

For currents, divide by $R_{L}$

## Three-Phase Uncontrolled

### Half-wave

The advantages of using three-phase power as compared to single-phase power are: (a) higher output voltages, (b) lower output ripple, (c) higher input power factor and (d) reduced harmonic distortion of the input current.

$V_{av} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}V_{m}}{2\pi}$
$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{1+ \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4\pi}}$

For currents, divide by $R_{L}$
