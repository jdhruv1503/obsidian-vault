### Half-wave

$V_{avg} = \frac{V_{s}}{\pi}$

$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{s}}{2}$

## Three-Phase Uncontrolled

The advantages of using three-phase power as compared to single-phase power are: (a) higher output voltages, (b) lower output ripple, (c) higher input power factor and (d) reduced harmonic distortion of the input current.
