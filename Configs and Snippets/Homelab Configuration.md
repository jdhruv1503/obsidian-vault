I use  a minimal install of Debian as my distro.
Add disk using ventoy
Run the command line installer as I prefer it
Use expert mode to get more options to set up a minimal install
Use guided partitioning but then edit the partition table to set up a 16G swap space
- Image for partition table

Fairly standard: create users
Use phone hotspot as I can't connect to the institute WIFI with the inbuilt networkmanager

Then deselect EVERYTHING except for Debian - I'll manually install components later
Let it download and install

It installed Gnome for some reason, lol
add user to sudoers file
Use apt to install openssh-server, nano
Use apt to uninstall gnome
