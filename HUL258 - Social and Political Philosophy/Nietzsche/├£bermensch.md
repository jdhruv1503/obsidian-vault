The superman/overman is an ideal individual who has transcended the confinements of traditional morality, class/status, et., cetera. To note: traditional morality to Nietzsche is a pseudo-reality. The Übermensch is the individual who has finally escaped the herd-mentality.

Nietzsche worried that, if we’re not careful, the death of God would lead to a deep nihilism. Recognizing Western values (derived from Christianity) as foundationless, yet not proactively replacing them with anything, we’d inevitably end up burying our existential angst deep down. We’d pick our fates from one of the following: delude ourselves with false beliefs, become irretrievably depressed, or distract ourselves with vacuous pursuits and meaningless entertainment.

While Nietzsche is no fan of Christianity, he recognizes that the removal of its values is dangerous. Christianity, flawed though it is, at least provides some structure and meaning to people’s lives. It offers not just a set of values but a coping mechanism for suffering.

Erode Christian values — erode the coping mechanism — and how will people bear existence? As [Kierkegaard also questions when discussing purpose in life](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/kierkegaard-on-finding-the-meaning-of-life/), how will humanity stand the yawning abyss of meaninglessness? How will they deal with the inevitable pain and suffering that all humans, living imperfect mortal lives, must face?

> "Behold! I shall show you the Last Man....The earth has become small, and upon it hops the Last Man, who makes everything small... A little poison now and then: that produces pleasant dreams. And a lot of poison at last, for a pleasant death. They still work, for work is entertainment. But they take care the entertainment does not exhaust them... No herdsmen and one herd. Everyone wants the same thing, everyone is the same: whoever thinks otherwise goes voluntarily into the madhouse... ‘We have discovered happiness,’ say the Last Men, and blink." - an apathetic, shallow humanity.

Enter Nietzsche’s Übermensch, an alternative future for humanity, where we need not rely on any standard of values but our _own_.

The idea of the Übermensch fills the void left by the death of God. Defying nihilism, it provides a new basis for value. For Nietzsche doesn’t only want to dismantle decaying, unhealthy Christian values; with his Übermensch, he wants to provide us with a template, a vision, for something _better_.

One of the main problems Nietzsche has with Christian values is they aspire to what he calls an ‘ascetic ideal’: the denial of inner drives or desires we cannot help but have (like those for food or sex) in the name of ‘virtue’. This repression, this invention of ‘sin’, is psychologically unhealthy, and leads to perpetual guilt and self-loathing.

Nietzsche thinks we must thus discard notions of ‘sin’ and asceticism and rebuild our value systems in healthier, life-affirming ways. Not the rejection of our desires, not the denial of the urges and forces that make up our lives, but the sublimation, sculpting and channeling of them into a psychologically healthy and beautiful creation, an aesthetic whole.

When announcing the death of God, Nietzsche questions: “Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?” The Übermensch is the answer to this question: he is _human-become-god_. Rather than look externally, the Übermensch is his _own_ determiner of value. He transcends the petty needs of ‘man’ and moves beyond illusions to live and take joy in the _here_ and _now_ of life on Earth. He affirms his own character, and has the power and fortitude to say ‘yes’ to all of life’s joys and all of life’s pains.

There is NO one-size-fits-all solution.

What is the aesthetic vision around which _you_ could organize yourself to fulfill your greatest potential?
