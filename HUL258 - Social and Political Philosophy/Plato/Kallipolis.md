- In the Republic, Plato outlines his vision of the ideal state - Kallipolis - governed by philosopher-kings and founded on principles of justice. 

- Kallipolis has a tripartite class structure:

1. Artisans / Producers

- The lowest class comprising farmers, craftsmen, traders etc. They possess the virtue of temperance and focus on production.

- Allowed to own private property and wealth. Live regular family lives.

- Provide goods and services for the whole society. Do not participate in ruling.

2. Auxiliaries / Warriors 

- The military class that upholds order and defends the state. Possess the virtue of courage.

- Selected from among the most promising and valorous children. Undergo rigorous physical and mental training. 

- Live communally with no private property. Meals taken in common mess halls.

3. Guardians / Rulers

- The highest ruling class who govern society justly and wisely. Possess the virtues of wisdom, courage and temperance in full.

- Rigorously trained and tested over decades in philosophy, reason, mathematics, dialectics etc. to know the Forms.

- Live an ascetic communal life with no private property or families. Every earthly need catered to so they can focus purely on ruling.

- Selected from among the best guardian children who show greatest aptitude for higher knowledge. Absolute rule.

- The Kallipolis reflects and fosters justice in individuals - reason controlling appetites and passions to establish inner harmony.

Slavery

- Plato accepts slavery as a natural and necessary institution, inherent in the hierarchical structure of society.

- Slaves mainly consist of prisoners of war who are forced into bondage to serve the classes above them. 

- They engage in manual labor, domestic service, mining etc. Freed from having to provide their own subsistence, they can fully serve others.

- The absence of slaves performing necessary functions would undermine the division of classes and virtues in the Kallipolis.

Women

- Plato advocates radical equality of the sexes. Women can serve in all classes based on ability.

- Female guardians receive the same rigorous education and training as males. Those capable become philosopher queens.

- To ensure vigorous guardian stock, Plato proposes eugenic state arranged breeding. But children still held in common.

- While accepting equality of sexes in potential, Plato stereotypes women as more oriented to the material/appetitive.

- Still, his meritocratic placement of women and men in classes based on reason alone was remarkably progressive for his time.

In summary, Plato's Kallipolis is an ideal society built on specialization of function according to ability, cultivation of virtues, rule of reason, and harmony between classes. While containing controversial elements like communism for the upper classes, eugenics, censorship, and slavery, it represented a bold vision of a just state guided by those with true knowledge. Plato's Republic has deeply influenced Western political philosophy.

Plato's Theory of an Ideal State:

- The ideal state has three classes: producers/workers, auxiliaries/soldiers, and guardians/rulers. Each class has specific virtues it must embody.

- The rulers are the most virtuous as they possess wisdom. They are philosopher-kings trained rigorously in reason, mathematics, and dialectics to know the forms.

- To remove distractions, the ruling class lives communally with no private property or families. Their needs are taken care of so they can focus on ruling justly.

- The society is built on a "noble lie" or myth about metals in people's souls to convince them of the proper class divisions. 

- Poetry and arts are censored to remove unhealthy models and appeal to emotions. Education shapes citizens towards order, harmony, and reason.

- The just state mirrors a just soul, with reason controlling spirited and appetitive parts. Justice is each part fulfilling its proper role.
