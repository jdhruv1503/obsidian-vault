- Aristotle believes that politics should aim at justice, which promotes happiness. Justice entails ruling for the common good.
- Natural rights: Aristotle does not explicitly use this term, but believes that certain things are inherently owed to human beings to allow them to achieve their telos.
- These include the right to participation in politics to exercise reason/speech and develop virtue. Denial of political participation denies natural rights.
- Also, proportional equality - equal opportunity for unequal talents to exercise reason/virtue. Equal opportunity for all citizens to fulfill functions essential to their nature.
- Justice requires that each person in a political community be afforded their due based on nature - opportunity to develop through political action into a virtuous, reasoning citizen.
- Laws must be framed to allow for this, or they deny justice. Laws should not privilege one group over others in ability to fulfill their telos and achieve happiness through reason/virtue.
- Aristotle criticized democracy for allowing the poor majority to seize control and wealth from the minority, upsetting justice. Majority rule must still respect proportional equality.
- He conceived of justice as a balance between opposing principles like rich/poor. The goal is to actualize justice within the real-world limitations of the community based on possibility.
- Justice comes through properly exercising reason via politics. But in actual states, law embodies and approximates reason in a reliable, predictable way. Rule of law = rule of reason.
- The concept of justice is tied to reason, nature, law, and allowing all citizens to develop unimpeded towards their telos. Obstructing this contradicts nature and is unjust.
- Justice requires ruling according to reason/law to promote the common good. It entails respecting humans' natural function and providing conditions for fulfillment.
