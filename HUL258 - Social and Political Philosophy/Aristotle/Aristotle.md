In summary, Aristotle's key ideas in Politics emphasize that human beings are inherently political animals, meant to participate in politics to exercise reason through speech and develop virtue, which allows them to achieve their natural identity and telos. Exclusion from political participation denies natural rights and justice by impeding a human being's capacity to develop in accordance with their inherent nature and potential. Laws and government should aim at justice by respecting human telos and creating conditions that allow citizens to fulfill functions essential to their nature. Aristotle's political thought ties together human nature, identity, justice, and the purpose of political community in a profoundly influential way.
