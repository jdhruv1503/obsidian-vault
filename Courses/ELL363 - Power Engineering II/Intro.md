- NR load flow
- Decoupled load flow
- Fast decoupled load flow with assumptions (constant Jacobians - symmetrical and sparse)

---

# DC load flow

- All bus voltages assumed constant at nominal values, 1pu
- omit from B', angle-shifting effects of phase shifters by setting t = 1 (at 0deg)
- omit from B', effect of megavar flow (shunt caps and reactors)
- set taps t=1 of off-nominal transformers
- Ignore R in equivalent pi network (lossless network)

$\Delta |V_f| = 0$

$[ \bar B] [ \Delta |V| ] = [ \frac{ \Delta Q }{ |V| } ]$ is not required

$P_{ij} = B_{ij} (\delta i - \delta j)$
