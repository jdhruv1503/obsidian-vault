Social contract theory has been one of the most influential frameworks for understanding the legitimate foundations of political authority and obligation. Though there are various interpretations, the core idea is that the state derives its moral right to exercise power and issue laws from an implicit agreement or "contract" between members of society to coordinate their conduct under the sovereign authority of government.

This conceptual device of an original social contract aims to justify political institutions by grounding them in the rational self-interest and consent of the governed rather than mere coercive force or divine right. In exchanging some personal freedoms, the contractors receive civil order, security, and State protection of their natural rights in return.

Thomas Hobbes - The Archetype of Social Contract 

The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes is considered the founding father of modern social contract theory with his landmark work Leviathan (1651). For Hobbes, the foundational "State of Nature" is a hypothetical scenario of what life would be like without any legitimate sovereign political authority to impose order and enforce rules over human conduct.

In Hobbes' dramatic depiction, the State of Nature is a miserable condition of near-perpetual conflict and violence - a "war of all against all" - due to humankind's incessant competition for limited resources and lack of a common power to keep them in awe. With no firm property rights or overarching supremacy, everyone has a natural right to everything, ensuring constant insecurity and fear.

To escape this intolerable state of privation and strife, it becomes rational for people to voluntarily agree to alienate their individual rights of self-governance to an absolute ruler or "Leviathan". In this seminal social contract, citizens trade their natural freedoms for the monopoly of force by a sovereign who can credibly maintain peace, enforce property rights, and ensure mutual compliance with public rules.

Hobbes argued that without this awesome secular authority, the degeneration into a bellum omnium contra omnes (war of all against all) is inevitable. Critics, however, rebuke Hobbes' demonization of human nature as unnecessarily cynical and his solutions as rationalizing tyranny and absolutism under the sovereign's unchecked powers.

John Locke - The Father of Liberalism

The English philosopher John Locke presented a radically different conception of the social contract in his Two Treatises of Government (1689) that spawned modern liberal political theory. Like Hobbes, Locke posited an original State of Nature with no government, but interpreted it as a state of "perfect freedom" where all are born free and equal with inalienable natural rights to life, liberty and estate (property).

However, the State of Nature lacks civil authority to impartially judge disputes and sufficiently protect people's claims over time, making it inherently unstable. So Locke hypothesized that rational individuals would unanimously consent to a social contract forming a legitimate government and body of laws derived from the people to uphold and safeguard their pre-existing natural rights and liberties.

But crucially for Locke, government's just powers are conditional on respecting and preserving citizens' rights, ensuring that the sovereign is always subordinate to the people via the rule of law. If rulers violate the compact through tyrannical actions, the people have the right to dissolve their allegiance and resist or overthrow the regime.

Locke's social contract thus establishes constitutional government with separation of powers, checks on authority, and people's rights to "life, liberty and property". This hugely influential framework aimed to impose moral limits on governments through citizens' ongoing tacit consent.

Critics allege Locke's consent-based theory paradoxically becomes a rationalization for unlimited democratic majority rule, enabling the transgression of minority rights. There are also challenges pinpointing when exactly citizens agreed to any specific social contract.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau - The General Will

The French Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau advanced a highly original model of the social contract in his treatises The Social Contract and Discourse on the Origin of Inequality. Rousseau sharply departed from Hobbes and Locke by rejecting the idea of natural rights derived from a pre-political State of Nature, which he saw as a philosophical fiction.

Instead, Rousseau posited that human beings evolved from an ancient naturalistic state with virtually no language or abstract reasoning to gradually form primitive social bonds and establish humanity's first imperfect institutions. He thus saw civil society itself as an unnatural and inegalitarian "denaturing" of pristine human freedom and innocence originally enjoyed.

To resolve this deterioration, Rousseau conceived of the social contract as a voluntary agreement between the whole body of people to entirely alienate their personal rights and freedoms to the "general will" of that collective sovereign authority. Submitting one's particular will to the "general will" is the only way to achieve true legitimacy, equality, and freedom under self-imposed laws and norms.

Rousseau envisioned this direct self-rule of the popular sovereign will enacting laws in the common good - transcending the mere sum of factional interests - via direct participatory democracy. Representative democracy was rejected as a form of unjust tutelage.

However, critics have long charged that Rousseau's conceptof the intangible, metaphysical "general will" as theoretically identical to popular sovereignty yet somehow detached from the actual will of all opens the door to majoritarian tyranny, dogmatism, and paradox. Defining what is the true "general will" in complex societies raises severe epistemological challenges.

Rousseau's opponents allege his social contract collapses into a rigid unitary collectivism justifying the denial of individual autonomy, diversity, and minority rights - particularly his advocacy of legally enforced civil religion binding citizens to the state's creed.

Conclusion

While their specific formulations significantly diverge, the early modern contractarians all attempted to locate the origins of legitimate political authority and obligation in rational grounds of reasoned assent and popular self-interest rather than naked power alone. Their thought experiments pioneered some of the most durable concepts in political theory like the state of nature, natural rights, consent of the governed, sovereignty, the social compact, and constitutional limits on state power.  

However, critics counter that the entire social contract metaphor is a thinly veiled legitimation myth, obscuring how political authority and subjugation have historically been established through violence, coercion, conquest and oppression rather than some hypothetical voluntary agreement between free and equal people securing mutual advantage.

Another perennial critique charges that the contractarian models excessively rely on hypothetical rational choice reasoning abstracted from psychological, cultural, and sociological factors to artificially derive justifications for particular regimes, laws and policies. This highlights deeper philosophical unease about whether contractarian theories are truly explanatory or simply elaborate tautologies defining legitimacy through circular notions of consent.

Moreover, some argue the contractarian premise itself that people must alienate their natural freedoms and rights to a collective political sovereign is a philosophically confused and logically contradictory framework. Quasi-anarchist theory retorts that people are born with inviolable self-sovereign rights that can never be validly alienated or transferred in total to any political ruler.

Nonetheless, the contractarian philosophers were pivotal in developing some of the core ideas in Western political thought around individual liberty, property, rights, majoritarianism, and constitutional limits on state power. And while empirical doubts remain over its historical veracity, social contract theory offers one of the most intuitively compelling moral justifications for government authority as ultimately derived from some principle of popular consent rather than raw domination.

The contractarian legacy thus continues to shape debates over the legitimate scope, foundations, and exercise of political power in the modern era. Their enduring influence attests to the perpetual human quest to locate sources of rightful rule and political obligation beyond mere coercive force.

## Property and Solitude

Here is a 1000 word discussion of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau's ideas on property and solitude:

The social contract theorists had markedly different perspectives on the concepts of property and solitude that reveal deeper distinctions in their philosophical worldviews. 

For Thomas Hobbes, in the brutish State of Nature without a sovereign authority, there are no lasting property rights or possessions that are securely owned. The permanent state of anarchy and war makes it such that any perceived "property" can be constantly usurped by others through force or fraud. In this anarchic nightmare vision, there is no true enjoyment of the few goods one manages to appropriate before others violently seize them.

Hobbes saw the establishment of a powerful Leviathan state via the social contract as the only way to constitute and enforce stable property rights and possessions. By voluntarily submitting to an absolute sovereign with a monopoly on violence, citizens can be guaranteed security in keeping "whatsoever a man transfers his Right unto" whether obtained through first possession, exchange, or donation. The commonwealth alone has the ability to adjudicate and coercively uphold mutually recognized property claims in the long-run interest of civic peace.

For Hobbes then, property rights and holdings are entirely conventional - purely created by the explicit or tacit covenants and sovereign edicts establishing positive law and property systems. They have no basis in any pre-political "natural law". Any notion of inviolable private property existing prior to and taking precedence over the will of the sovereign is incoherent to Hobbes. In subjecting themselves to the Leviathan to escape bellum omnium contra omnes, people entirely forfeit any prior "solitude" or individual autonomy as the price for exiting the State of Nature.

In stark contrast, John Locke grounded his theory of property rights as originating from natural law in the pre-political condition rather than solely deriving from civil institutions. In Locke's State of Nature, individuals can indeed claim full private property rights over portions of the earth and its fruits through mixing their labor with previously unowned resources. Property arises through the reasoned application of one's productive efforts rather than mere first possession.

Locke posited that the social contract establishing government aimed to better secure these innate natural property entitlements rather than create artificial rights ex nihilo. By consenting to the public authority, people essentially "quit" solitude and exemption from the community's laws in order to better preserve and uphold their private possessions and personal liberties which pre-existed political society.

So for Locke, property is a sacrosanct private sphere that civil government is primarily instituted to protect from external interference rather than being solely the creation of the legislative sovereign. He saw unchecked state power over property as a form of tyranny and appropriation of what belongs to the industrious people by natural right. However, Locke allowed that taxation of property and inheritance laws could be enacted by a properly constituted government deriving its power from the people.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau completely rejected the notion of inviolable natural property rights and saw all legitimate possessions as deriving purely from the civil laws and conventions enacted by the "general will" of the popular sovereign. Private property was an artificial social construct instituted by humans to preserve inequality and social stratification.

In Rousseau's romanticized philosophical vision, the original State of Nature was a blissful period of solitary human existence lacking any abstract notions of "mine" or "thine" in terms of permanent individual possessions or exclusive ownership claims. People had open access to the earth's natural provisions without man-made notions of property.

The disastrous establishment of the first societies and private property regimes represented the unhappy origins of greed, vice, violence and human "denaturing" which distorted our primordial equality and innocence in pursuit of vain status symbols. In Rousseau's memorable lines, "The first man who, having fenced off a plot of ground, took it into his head to say this is mine and found people simple enough to believe him was the true founder of civil society."

Therefore, for Rousseau, private property rights are not eternal truths or rights but shifting artifices established by tacit societal agreement. Once the social contract is enacted, citizens entirely alienate any notion of pre-existing possessions or resource claims that previously stood apart from the collective popular will. All holdings now become conditional upon the sanction of the "general will" as articulated by the sovereign lawgiver. Any pretense of natural property solitude or autonomy outside communal approval is an illegitimate fiction.

So while Hobbes saw property as merely a creature of positive law created by the sovereign, Locke upheld it as a pre-political natural right, and Rousseau branded it a socially-constructed convention warping humanity's initial noble "solitude" of commonality. These divergent conceptualizations evinced their broader beliefs about human nature, the social compact's aim, and the moral basis for property claims - a perennial source of debate in political philosophy.
