_Summary_: Nietzsche’s own life may appear pessimistic, but his writings can be nothing but life-affirming. The catch-all trope (caricature) of his concerns could be put together in the following imagery: the sole individual fighting against all-odds. 

In pop-culture, the Nietzschean character is evident in movies like, Little Miss Sunshine (2006), Fight Club (1999), Groundhog Day (1993), et cetera. The common thread: 

(1) there is an existential crisis, and 
(2) the Nietzschean hero confronts this crisis against the absence of eternal meaning, motivation, or moral purity – he fights against the tyranny of meaninglessness of life governing under the guise of moral norms and whatnot.

Nietzsche’s contribution to modern thought is his uncompromising criticism of traditional morality (often represented via religion/Christianity). The general populace is under a false-consciousness made-up of uncritical ideas.
