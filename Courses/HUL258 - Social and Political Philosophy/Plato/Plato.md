Plato (427-347 B.C.) was an ancient Greek philosopher and one of the most influential thinkers in Western philosophy. He was a student of Socrates and later founded the Academy in Athens, which was the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Some key points on Plato:

- Plato was born into an aristocratic Athenian family during the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. This war led to the decline of the Greek world, political instability in Athens, and the execution of Socrates. 

- Plato was deeply influenced by Socrates and became his devoted student. Socrates transformed Plato's outlook on life and showed him the value of the philosophical life over the political life.

- After Socrates' death, Plato recognized that philosophy and politics cannot be separated. This led him to develop political philosophy and search for ways to reform Greek politics.

- Plato's political theory is based on his theory of forms - the concept that universal, unchanging truths or ideals (forms) exist apart from their physical manifestations in the world. For example, there is an ideal form of Justice that exists beyond any examples of justice we see.

- In the Republic, Plato outlines his vision of the ideal state ruled by philosopher-kings who have knowledge of the forms. They create a just society through a proper ordering of classes and education of citizens.

Plato on Taming the Passions:

- Plato recognizes that humans possess appetites, desires and unruly passions that can corrupt the soul and lead to vice when uncontrolled. 

- Reason is required to control the passions - thumos (spiritedness) and appetites of pleasure, power, wealth etc. When reason governs properly, the soul achieves inner justice and harmony.

- Plato describes the tyrannical man controlled by lawless passions as wretched and enslaved. The philosophical man who masters his passions through reason lives a life of fulfillment. 

- Inner mastery over passions is required before one can meaningfully practice justice externally. Reason must rule for political leaders to be just and not enslaved by greed and power.

- Plato's program of ruler selection, communal living, censorship, and education in the Republic all aim to produce rulers who are not slaves to their passions but virtuous philosopher-kings.

In summary, Plato's immense influence stems from his idealism, theory of forms, holistic political vision, emphasis on education and cultivation of reason to master passions, and a just society governed by those with true knowledge and virtue. His work continues to inspire philosophical inquiry on the human condition, nature of knowledge, and just ordering of society.
