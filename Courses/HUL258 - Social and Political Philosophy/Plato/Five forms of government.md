Here are the 5 forms of government described by Plato in The Republic:

1. Aristocracy

- The ideal state ruled by philosopher-kings who have knowledge of the forms. They create a harmonious and just society through proper division of classes and cultivation of virtues.

2. Timocracy

- A state ruled by warriors and honor-lovers. Rulers focus on expansion through warfare rather than reason and wisdom. Appears when aristocracy decays.

3. Oligarchy 

- A state ruled by the rich where wealth is valued above all. Rulers are miserly and narrowly focused on material gain. Emerges from the decay of timocracy.

4. Democracy

- A state where freedom and equality are valued, and people can live how they want. But this leads to chaotic pursuits of petty pleasures, with no order or unified vision. Rises when wealth becomes diluted in oligarchy. 

5. Tyranny

- An oppressive state ruled by an absolute dictator who comes to power by claiming to help the oppressed. But the tyrant enslaves everyone to satisfy his insatiable desires. Tyranny arises from the anarchy of democracy.

Plato sees aristocracy as the ideal but unstable. States decay progressively from aristocracy to timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and finally tyranny, as virtues give way to passions of honor, greed, and lawless desires. each subsequent government is more dysfunctional than the previous one.
