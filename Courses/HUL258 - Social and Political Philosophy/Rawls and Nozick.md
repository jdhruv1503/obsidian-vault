John Rawls' A Theory of Justice reinvigorated political philosophy with its novel contractarian approach to formulating principles of social justice to regulate the basic structure of society. At the core of Rawls' theory is the idea of the "original position" - a thought experiment where rational individuals operate behind a "veil of ignorance" about their future socioeconomic status to derive fair principles for distributing rights, duties and social goods.

The Veil of Ignorance and Original Position

Rawls asks us to imagine individuals in an "original position" of radical ignorance about any particular facts regarding their forthcoming place in society. Behind this "veil of ignorance", these representative parties have no knowledge of their race, sex, talents, social class, beliefs, or any other attributes that could sway their judgment towards self-interest. They are entirely deprived of personal circumstances, historical information, or other morally arbitrary contingencies.

From this baseline of simple ignorance about their potential identities, Rawls argues these rationally self-interested yet impartial and equally situated people would accept two fundamental principles of justice as fair terms for governing the basic structure of society:

1) The Greatest Equal Liberty Principle: Each person has an equal right to the most extensive liberties compatible with similar liberties for others. Certain basic civil and political liberties like freedom of speech, conscience, property rights, etc. must be equally assigned.

2) The Difference Principle: Social and economic inequalities are permitted if (a) the inequalities are attached to positions and offices open to all under fair equality of opportunity, and (b) the inequalities are to the greatest expected benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

The first principle takes priority over the second, ensuring that basic liberties can only be curtailed for the sake of other basic liberties, not economic gains or social incentives. And the difference principle allows only those economic inequalities that maximally benefit society's most disadvantaged class through incentives and wealth creation versus enforced equality.

So the core insight is that people operating behind the "veil" as purely rational prudential actors without knowledge of their future identities would not consent to arbitrary disadvantages or unfair discrimination. In choosing principles impartially and avoiding bias, Rawls believed we would unanimously accept his justice as fairness approach guaranteeing equal basic liberties and addressing inequality through fair equality of opportunity and the famous "maximin" difference principle.

However, Rawls' framework provoked numerous critiques, most notably from libertarian Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia. Nozick forcefully rejected Rawls' construction as still fatally rooted in an illicit "patterned" theory of distributive justice that failed to fully respect individuals' inviolable rights, property entitlements and freedom of voluntary exchange and transfer.

Nozick's Critique

Nozick charged that Rawls' difference principle implicitly rejects the idea of people's inviolable property rights by allowing coercive state redistribution of justly held assets to benefit the least well-off class - regardless of how those assets were originally acquired (through hard work, inheritance, etc). He saw this as philosophically akin to legitimizing forced labor and authorizing criminal redistribution.

The libertarian objection is that individuals have absolute private property rights over their legally acquired holdings that should be immune from redistributive policies aimed at patterning society towards a particular favored economic distribution or end-state. This violates the inviolability of just property holdings based solely on how one fares compared to others rather than the process by which assets were appropriated.

A further critique is that Rawls fallaciously infers consent to his principles based on their rational acceptance in an abstract original position - but this merely bootstraps certain arbitrary constraints and assumptions to generate the desired result. Stripping away all individual characteristics and interests makes the original position an incoherent basis for deriving principles individuals would actually agree to.

Moreover, Nozick argued the "veil of ignorance" is incoherent because the parties would still need to know relevant general facts about human society, the existence of scarcity, human psychology, economic incentives, different possible basic structures etc. Full ignorance of everything is impossible.

Additionally, Rawls' maximin assumption that, out of pure rationality alone, people would solely maximize the worst-case outcome via the difference principle seems arbitrary and fails to explain why one would not accept even an infinitesimal chance of an enormous gain.

Nozick and others claimed this fetishized risk-aversion irrationally prefers security over expected value maximization of total welfare. It assumes excessive prudence behind the veil despite risk preferences varying based on what is being risked.

Defenders of Rawls counter that while his theory does indeed violate strict libertarian principles of absolute self-ownership, it remains the most compelling justification for regulating background economic inequality and providing a social safety net. Poverty demonstrably undermines people's ability to fully enjoy basic liberties, so some form of redistributive policies are justified by equal liberty.

They argue that rational prudent persons behind the veil would indeed opt for maximin self-preservation rather risking extreme destitution. Society's most vulnerable deserve special priority, and robust property rights still exist within the constraints of the difference principle.

Furthermore, critics' assumptions that redistribution necessarily equates to criminal "theft" or forced labor are overblown. The difference principle simply endorses redistributive policies aimed at raising up the poorest class through incentive effects, public goods provision and reasonable tax regimes - not authoritarian leveling of all wealth.

As for the critique of bootstrapping, defenders argue some philosophical assumptions are inevitable in any social contract thought experiment. Rawls is simply making the most plausible ones in terms of isolating morally arbitrary factors and deriving principles all could agree to.

Another counterargument is that while Rawls' veil is indeed a convenient abstraction, it fruitfully models how people with differing attributes in existing societies could embrace consensus principles guaranteeing equal liberties and fair, regulated economic systems that uplift the least advantaged. It approximates how we would reason if knowledge of our specific privileges was obscured.

So while Nozick highlighted some apparent contradictions and blind spots in Rawls' theory, it remains one of the most comprehensive frameworks for distributive justice and the fair regulation of social and economic inequalities compatible with liberty. As with all grand philosophical thought experiments, however, there will inevitably be challenging holes to poke.

In the end, Rawls' achievement was breathing new life into political philosophy and clarifying the core egalitarian principles that arguably should ground a just, well-ordered society if we reason impartially and extend ethical consideration equally to all citizens regardless of circumstance. Whether he fully succeeded in deriving those principles is still hotly debated across political theory and applied ethics today.
