| Form of Government | Description |
|-|-|  
| Monarchy | Rule by one person for the common good |
| Aristocracy | Rule by a few people based on merit and virtue |   
| Polity | Rule by the many people, the middle class |
| Tyranny | Rule by one person in their own self-interest |
| Oligarchy | Rule by the wealthy few in their own interest |
| Democracy | Rule by the poor majority in their own interest |

- Monarchy, aristocracy, and polity are considered good forms of government by Aristotle, as they aim at the common good. 

- Tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy are considered perverted or corrupted forms, as they involve rule for private interests rather than the public good.

- Aristotle considers monarchy the ideal but impractical. Aristocracy and polity are more realistic best case scenarios.

- Rule of law, proportional equality, and a large middle class are important for achieving good government per Aristotle.

- Mixing elements of different forms, such as democracy and oligarchy, can lead to a well-balanced polity.

So in Aristotle's view, the best constitutions combine elements of different forms of government and rely on rule of law to ensure the common good is served rather than private interests. The worst put one class's interests above the common good.
