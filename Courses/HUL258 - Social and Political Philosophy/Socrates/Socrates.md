Socrates (470-399 B.C.) was an Athenian philosopher who did not write anything himself but is known through the writings of his students, especially Plato. Socrates transformed the study of philosophy by directing it towards ethics and examining how people should live their lives. 

- Socrates shifted philosophy away from studying nature and towards ethical questions about how humans should live. He believed the most important questions were about ethics, not physics.

- He believed virtue was the most important thing and defined it as knowledge of how to live a good life, not just technical skills. Virtue for him meant moral excellence that would lead to true happiness. 

- His view contrasted with the Sophists, who saw virtue as the ability to acquire power and possessions. The Sophists taught rhetoric and political techniques, while Socrates sought conceptual knowledge of ethics.

- Socrates' view implied an innate human social nature and purpose in the universe, unlike the Sophists' conventionalist view of society as an artificial construct serving individual interests.

Cosmic Order Reflected in Reason:

- Socrates believed human reason and conceptual knowledge reflect an orderly, ethical cosmic purpose. 
- He thought the logical structure of the mind corresponds to real order in the universe.
- This contrasts with the Sophists, who recognized no such cosmic order or purpose beyond the material world.

**Arguments Against Socrates' Teachings:**
Socrates' teachings could be criticized on several grounds. His extreme rationalism could be seen as implausible - humans are not as perfectly rational as he believed. His definition of virtue as knowledge seems to contradict common experience of people acting against their knowledge of right and wrong. His condemnation of pleasure and desire as evil is arguable, as pleasure can have positive value in moderation. Finally, his absolute confidence in his own knowledge could be seen as arrogance in light of his questioning of everyone else.
