Socrates' Contrast to the Sophists:

- The Sophists taught virtue was the ability to acquire power and possessions through rhetoric and political skill. Socrates said virtue was knowledge of ethics.

- The Sophists saw society and laws as artificial constructs individuals could use for their benefit. Socrates saw them as natural expressions of human social nature. 

- Socrates used dialectic questioning to draw out conceptual knowledge, as opposed to the Sophists' rhetoric aimed at swaying opinion.

- Socrates' ethics were based on universal, unchanging conceptual knowledge. The Sophists relied on common opinions about virtue that varied. 

- The Sophists justified political disorder by exalting the individual over society. Socrates upheld social order while also advocating reforms to align it with ethical knowledge.

- Socrates believed in an ethical cosmic order reflected in reason. The Sophists recognized no such purpose or order in the universe.
