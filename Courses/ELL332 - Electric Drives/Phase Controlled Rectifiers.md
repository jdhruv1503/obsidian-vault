## Single-Phase Uncontrolled

### Half-wave

$V_{avg} = \frac{V_{s}}{\pi}$

$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{s}}{2}$

For currents, divide by $R_{L}$
### Full-wave

$V_{avg} = \frac{2V_{s}}{\pi}$

$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{s}}{\sqrt{2}}$

For currents, divide by $R_{L}$
## Three-Phase Uncontrolled

### Half-wave

The advantages of using three-phase power as compared to single-phase power are: (a) higher output voltages, (b) lower output ripple, (c) higher input power factor and (d) reduced harmonic distortion of the input current.

$V_{av} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}V_{m}}{2\pi}$
$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{1+ \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4\pi}}$

For currents, divide by $R_{L}$
### Full-wave

$V_{av} = \frac{3V_{m}}{\pi}$
$V_{rms} = \frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}\sqrt{1+ \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2\pi}}$

For currents, divide by $R_{L}$
## Controlled

### Single-phase controlled

#### Half-wave

Resistive: $V_{DC} = \frac{V_{m}}{\pi}(1+cos(\alpha))$
Inductive: $V_{DC} = \frac{V_{m}}{\pi}(2cos(\alpha))$

### Three-phase controlled

All $V_{m}$ are line-line peak voltage
#### Half-wave

Resistive: $V_{DC} = \frac{3V_{m}}{2\pi}(cos(\alpha+30))$

#### Full-wave half-control

Resistive: $V_{DC} = \frac{3V_{m}}{2\pi}(1+cos(\alpha))$

#### Full-wave full-control

Resistive: $V_{DC} = \frac{3V_{m}}{\pi}(cos(\alpha))$
