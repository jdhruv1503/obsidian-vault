Compound proposition T for all inputs -> Tautology
Compound proposition F for all inputs -> Contradiction

**Satisfiable formula:** Compound proposition is satisfiable if there exists a truth assignment to the propsitional  variables in it, that makes it evaluate to T.

A formula is valid if it is true for all values of its terms. Satisfiability refers to the existence of a combination of values to make the expression true. So in short, a proposition is satisfiable if there is at least one `true` result in its truth table, valid if all values it returns in the truth table are `true`.

**Satisfiability** -the other way of interpretation  
A propositional statement is satisfiable if and only if, its truth table is not contradiction.  
Not contradiction means, it could be a tautology also.

Hence, every tautology is also Satisfiable.  
However, Satisfiability doesn't imply Tautology.  

Another thing to note is, if a propositional statement is Tautology, then its always valid.

Thus, Tautology implies ( Satisfiability + Validity ).

# p -> q: 

p implies q; if p then q; q when p; p is a sufficient condition for q; q is a necessary condition for p

(p -> q is the same as q' -> p')
