# Reconfigurable Platforms

## Configurable SoC
A **Configurable System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates:
- **Processor**: Handles general-purpose tasks.
- **Memory**: On-chip memory for data storage.
- **Reconfigurable Hardware**: Customizable logic blocks for application-specific tasks.
  - **Fine-Grained Reconfigurability**: Small logic blocks (e.g., FPGA).
  - **Coarse-Grained Reconfigurability**: Larger functional units (e.g., ALUs, DSP blocks).

### FPGA vs Network of Processors
- **FPGA**: Highly flexible, fine-grained reconfigurability.
- **Network of Processors**: Coarse-grained, optimized for specific tasks.
- **Goal**: Create application-specific programmable products.

## Reconfigurable Computing (RC)

### What is Reconfigurable Computing?
- **Definition**: Computing by building a custom circuit for a specific task, rather than executing a sequence of instructions.
- **Use Case**: Efficient for long-running computations like video processing, DSP, and network processing.

### Advantages of RC
1. **No Instruction Fetch**:
   - Eliminates the need for instruction caches and fetch logic.
2. **Bit Width and Constants**:
   - Custom circuits can be optimized for specific bit widths and constants, reducing hardware complexity.
   - Example: If X and Y are 8-bit values, and constants a = 0.25 and b = 0.5, the circuit can be much smaller and faster.
3. **Delay Reduction**:
   - Shifts and additions can be performed in a single cycle, reducing latency compared to traditional processors.

## FPGA-Based Reconfigurable Computing

### FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)
- **Programmable Fabric**: Can be dynamically reconfigured to implement custom logic.
- **Mapping to FPGA**:
  - Only time-consuming computations are mapped to the FPGA.
  - Computations are expressed in Hardware Description Language (HDL).
- **Structure**:
  - FPGA + Memory.

### Examples of FPGA-Based SoCs
1. **Triscend A7 SoC**:
   - Combines a microprocessor with FPGA-like reconfigurable logic.
   - Performs basic combinational and sequential logic functions.
2. **Xilinx Virtex II Pro**:
   - **Features**:
     - PowerPC-based cores.
     - High-speed transceivers (622 Mbps to 3.125 Gbps).
     - Multiple multipliers, logic cells, and RAM.
     - Configurable I/O pins.

## Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Computing

### What is Coarse-Grained Reconfigurability?
- **Definition**: Uses larger functional units (e.g., ALUs) connected via a hierarchical network.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Distributed Registers**: Registers are spread across the processing elements.
  - **Configure Once and Run**: The circuit is configured once and then executed without further reconfiguration.
  - **High Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)**: Can achieve parallelism of 100 or more.
  - **No Branch Instructions**: Eliminates the overhead of branch prediction and handling.

(Deepseek) - **Simplified Explanation**:
Coarse-grained reconfigurable computing uses larger, pre-defined processing units (like ALUs) connected in a network. Once configured, the system runs without needing further changes, achieving high parallelism and efficiency. It avoids the complexity of branch instructions, making it ideal for tasks like signal processing.
