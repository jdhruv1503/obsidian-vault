# System-on-Chip (SoC)

- A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates processors, caches, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices onto a single piece of silicon.
- This integration reduces product cost and is used whenever possible.
- More complex computers may require multiple chips due to size constraints.
- Smaller computers have shorter wires, enabling faster operation for the same power consumption.

### SoC Composition
- SoC consists of at least two or more complex micro-electronic macro components previously integrated into different single dies.
- Complex functionalities that once required heterogeneous components on a PCB are now integrated into a single silicon chip.

### Evolution of Embedded Systems
- Embedded systems have evolved from microcontrollers and discrete components to fully integrated SoCs.
- **Reason**: Advances in silicon process technology enable complete systems to be designed into one or few integrated devices.
- **Benefits**:
  - Space and power reductions.
  - Increased performance.
