## Advanced Robotics

- Robots were once considered fit only for dangerous, dirty and dull work.
    
- Today the typical applications of industrial robots include welding, painting, ironing, assembly, pick and place, palletizing, product inspection, and testing, all accomplished with high endurance, speed, and precision.
    
- **Three types of robots:**
    
    - Industrial arm robots:
        - 6-axis arms used for repetitive or potentially dangerous tasks
        - SCARA robots
        - Delta or Spider robots
    - Collaborative robots: designed to work alongside humans to perform the dull repetitive tasks
    - Software robots: used for the automation of reading forms and data entry

### Industrial Robots

- Industrial robots are typically large, fixed equipment designed for high-volume, extremely high-accuracy, and high-speed production.
- A serial robot arm can be described as a chain of links that are moved by joints which are actuated by motors.
- An end-effector, also called a robot hand, can be attached to the end of the chain.
- As other robotic mechanisms, robot arms are typically classified in terms of the number of degrees of freedom.
- **Typical industrial use cases:**
    - Assembly and Handling
    - Welding and Cutting
    - Packaging and Palletizing
    - Painting and Dispensing
- Industrial robots can present safety risks to human workers, so they usually require safety measures such as a cage to keep humans out of the robot’s work envelope.

### 6-axis Robotic Arms

- The number of axes corresponds to the number of ‘joints’ – or points – along the arm where it can bend or twist.
- Load capacities for industrial 6-Axis arms have the largest range, anywhere from small 3 kg units to monster 1000 kg systems.
- **Strengths:** Very flexible and can mimic the motion of a human arm. Very good at reaching in and around objects.
- **Weaknesses:** Can be more compliant and a little slower than other configurations due to the nature of the design.
- **Number of Axes:** Six, usually, but there is a new “snake” variant robot that adds a 7th axis that gives the system an even better ability to reach in and around obstacles.
- **Typical Load Capacities:** 3-600 kg

### SCARA Robots

- The SCARA or Selective Compliant Assembly Robot Arm is your high speed work horse, but they aren’t limited to assembly or pick-and-place applications such as building mobile phones.
- They can be very useful in applications such as dispensing, where you need to precisely follow a path at constant speeds while dispensing things like adhesives.
- **Strengths:** High Speed and very rigid with very good repeatability.
- **Weakness:** Available work area can be limited and not suited for manipulating objects in a vertical plane.
- **Number of Axes:** Three or Four – the fourth is determined if you need a wrist or twist axis about the Z-Axis (vertical).
- **Typical Load Capacities:** 1-20 kg

### Delta Robots

- Also referred to as “Spider Robots”, Delta Robots are one of the latest entrants into the main stream industrial robot world.
- They are best suited for super high speed pick-and-place applications with relatively light loads.
- Added vision technologies allow Deltas to distinguish and select different size, colour, or shape options and pick and place based on a programmed pattern.
- **Strengths:** Very High Speed.
- **Weakness:** Available work area can be limited in the vertical plane at the extents of its reach and it’s not suited for manipulating objects in a vertical plane. Due to the duty cycle requirements, there can be significant mechanical maintenance required.
- **Number of Axes:** Three or Four – the fourth is determined if you need a wrist or twist axis.
- **Typical Load Capacities:** 1-3 kg

### Collaborative Robots

- Cobots are ideal for manufacturers with low-volume, high-mix production or who need to safely automate processes alongside human workers.
- That might include automating a repetitive task and handing a part off to a human for inspection or to complete a complex decision-based assembly process
- Cobots typically have lower upfront costs and are easy to program with no previous experience, so they offer fast ROI.
- They are small and lightweight enough that they can be easily moved and redeployed to automate different processes throughout a manufacturing facility.
- Collaborative Robots are affordable, safe, highly adaptable, easily programmed or hand trained and have interchangeable end of arm tooling (EoAT).
- This makes them best suited for working along side humans in a shared workspace or for providing assistance to an industrial robot in a cage.

### Autonomous Mobile Robots

- Collaborative robots have been an important development in the robotics industry - the first automation technology that allows safe operation directly alongside human workers.
- Autonomous Mobile Robots
- Mobile robots are currently seen as the work-horses of ‘Industry 4.0' and their adoption rate into production processes is expected to increase in the next few years.

### Teaching Robots in the Virtual World

- In the IoT robots are cyberphysical systems as they straddle the real and the virtual worlds.
- They learn through interacting with the real world and through ML and AI enhanced big data in the virtual world.
- As industrial robotics become more and more advanced and traditional factories are upgraded to smart factories, the amount of work and expertise that goes into training these robotics arms will increase commensurately.
- **Teach Pendant:** an operator using a teaching pendant can slow down the equipment so that they can plot the movements of the robot to accommodate the change in procedure.
- **Programming by Demonstration:** as with the teach pendant, the operator has the ability to “show” the robot, with a high degree of precision, a series of new movements and store that information into the robot’s computer.
- **Offline Simulation:** A danger to teaching the robot is the downtime so offline simulation is an attractive alternative. The movements an travel can be analyzed and plotted using a computer and the resulting code downloaded to the robot.
- **Machine Learning:** have an operator show the robot how to perform a particular task and then allow the robot to analyze that information to determine the most efficient sequence of motions that need to be completed in order to replicate the task. As the robot learns the task, it has the opportunity to discover new ways to improve the way in which the task is performed.

### Artificial Intelligence in Industry 5.0

- Manufacturing is responsible for a significant part of the worldwide energy consumption and artificial intelligence has an enormous potential to benefit environmental sustainability and pave the way to a more eco-friendly and energy-efficient manufacturing.
- Artificial intelligence can solve a number of issues that are critical for sustainable manufacturing.
- **This includes:**
    - excessive use of materials,
    - redundant production of scrap waste,
    - inefficient supply chain management, logistics and
    - unequal distribution of energy resources.
- AI enabled Embedded Control can eradicate all of these difficulties.
- Artificial intelligence is an advanced technology that has the potential to fundamentally transform the manufacturing industry and create unparalleled working opportunities within the “missing middle” and forge the path towards smart, efficient and sustainable manufacturing.

### ML – 5.0: Digital Twins

- Digital Twins provide real-time diagnostics and evaluations of the production, the performance and monitoring prediction, and the visualization process of all kinds of key parameters.
- To generate the models that understand the physical systems, machine learning unsupervised algorithms are used.
- As the data is processed, these algorithms look for patterns of behaviour and detect anomalies.
- They also can process external data, such as research, industry data, social media, and media.
- Digital Twins are a tool not only applicable for product design, but also for simulating the performance of existing physical products.

### ML-5.0: Quality Control

- Machine Learning can be applied for product inspection and quality controls.
- ML-based algorithms learn from historical data that distinguish good products from those with defects, thus automating the inspection and supervision process.
- Deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks detect visual clues indicative of quality problems in products and parts in highly complex assembly processes..

### ML in 5.0: Quality Improvement

- Customers expects flawless products, as defective products cause non-conformities that damage the reputation of the company and its profit margins.
- ML can foresee quality problems right down the production line.
- Artificial vision is an example of a ML solution, in which high-resolution cameras are used to monitor defects.
- This can be combined with a cloud-based data processing framework to generate an automated response.

### Supply Chain 4.0

- “Supply Chain 4.0 - Is the application of the Internet of Things, the use of advanced robotics, and the application of advanced analytics of big data in supply chain management: place sensors in everything, create networks everywhere, automate anything, and analyze everything to significantly improve performance and customer satisfaction"
- Horizontal Value Chain integration with Industry 4.0 involves connecting all parts of your supply chain to the manufacturing plant.
- This deeper alignment improves visibility, flexibility, and productivity while also enhancing levels of automation.
- The supply chain cloud forms the next level of collaboration in the supply chain between customers, the company, and suppliers, providing either a shared logistics infrastructure or even joint planning solutions.
- Especially in noncompetitive relationships, partners can decide to tackle supply chain tasks together to save admin costs, and also to leverage best practices and learn from each other.
