- The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers ( UIDs ) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.
- A thing in the IoT can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an IP address and is able to transfer data over a network.
- IoT is a sensor network of billions of smart devices that connect people, systems and other applications to collect and share data.

### IoT Ecoystem

- An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors and communication hardware to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments.
- IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally.

### IoT applications

### Sample: Consumer IOT products & Services

1. Helmet Concussion Sensor
2. Medical Alert Watch
3. Smart Fitness Clothing and Smart Running Shoes
4. One-Button Product Purchases: “Order at the click of a button!” Amazon has taken that phrase literally and produced physical branded buttons called Amazon Dash that link to products in your home. Say you run out of laundry powder. You can press your Dash button for Tide and Amazon will reorder your Tide Powder product for you. No need to sign onto the Web, fumble with payment methods, or retype credit card numbers.
5. Garden Sensors
6. Smart Televisions IoT things presentation - Davis M Onsakia

### Kinsa thermometer

Monitoring your temperature and can call your doctor as necessary

### Connected car story

The connected car is equipped with internet connections and software that allow people to stream music, look up movie times, be alerted of traffic and weather conditions, and even power driving-assistance services such as self-parking.

### Smart farming: Use of IOT to improve agriculture

- In IoT-based smart farming, a system is built for monitoring the crop field with the help of sensors (light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc.) and automating the irrigation system. The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere. This is highly efficient compared to the traditional/conventional approach.

- In terms of environmental issues, IoT-based smart farming provides great benefits including: better and efficient water usage, and optimization of inputs and treatments.
- Therefore, smart farming based on IoT technologies enables growers and farmers to reduce waste and enhance productivity.
- Some of the IoT applications in this area are:
    - Precision farming
    - Agricultural drones
    - Livestock monitoring
    - Smart greenhouses

### IOT CHALLENGES

Security, privacy and data sharing issues

- Because IoT devices are closely connected, all a hacker has to do is exploit one vulnerability to manipulate all the data, rendering it unusable. And manufacturers that don't update their devices regularly -- or at all -- leave them vulnerable to cybercriminals.
- However, hackers aren't the only threat to the internet of things; privacy is another major concern for IoT users. For instance, companies that make and distribute consumer IoT devices could use those devices to obtain and sell users' personal data.
- Challenges with IIoT:
    - Security of data – same as above
    - Reliability and stability – of IIoT sensors
    - Connectivity of all the systems in IIoT setup – no maintenance envisioned?
