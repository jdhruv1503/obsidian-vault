- Basically, a micro-controller is a device
which integrates a number of the
components of a microprocessor system
onto a single microchip.

A micro-controller combines onto the same
microchip:
The CPU core
Memory (both ROM and RAM)
Some parallel digital I/O & more

## Components

- A Timer module to allow the micro-
controller to perform tasks for certain time
periods.
- A serial I/O port to allow data to flow
between the micro-controller and other
devices such as a PC or another micro-
controller.
- An ADC to allow the micro-controller to
accept analogue input data for processing.
