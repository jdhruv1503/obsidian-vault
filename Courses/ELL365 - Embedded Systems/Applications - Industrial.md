- Industry 4.0
- Industry 5.0

### The 4th Industrial Revolution

- Industry 4.0
    - An inter-connected world driven by real-time data
    - Data is collected from everything and everywhere
    - Data drives decision making, automation and controls processes
    - Automated processes and integrated value chains reduce costs and increase profit
    - Smart Factories using interconnected cyberphysical systems to produce smart products

### The Connected Factory

- Technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) enable machine-to-machine communication (M2M), which interact and “talk” to each other in a digital way and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which merge the physical world with the digital world.
- Big Data, which is information that surfaces patterns hidden within the data, which in return can be translated into new business opportunities for organizations’.
- The Big Data, that these sensors generate, enables IoT to bring value through real-time data analysis and improving decision making for organizations.

### Core Industry 4.0 Technologies

- Machine-2-Machine operation (Machine learning)
- Cyber Physical Machines (Interoperability of data, robots, and computers)
- Intelligent systems – self learning machines, self calibrating processes with fix-before-break operation)
- Intelligent products – smart products that know what they are, how they are to be made, and their history
- Deterministic networks – essential for real-time manufacturing
- Deterministic feedback and control
- Big Data collection (Cloud & Edge deployments)
- Digital Twins (clones of machines or processes used for analysis, modeling and testing)
- Real time and batch analysis – streaming and in-memory analytics to enhance process control and gain insights into operational efficiencies

### Technology Enablers of Industry 4.0

- Some key technologies are:
    - Industrial Internet of Things
    - Cyber Physical Systems
    - Cloud – provides global reach and near infinite resources (newish)
    - Advanced Robotics –high speed, accurate and tireless
    - Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing) – P.o.C, remote assembly
    - Big Data – provides for storage and data handling methods at vast scale
    - Machine Learning - provides the advanced algorithms we need to make sense of machine-tool data
    - Artificial Intelligence – delivers the means for predictive and advanced analysis of machine-tool data

### Introducing the Industry 5.0 Evolution

- Industry 5.0 complements and extends Industry 4.0. It reaffirms the environmental and social factors and not just economic or technological, by framing how industry and emerging societal trends and needs can co-exist.
- By developing innovative technologies in a human-centric way, Industry 5.0 can support and empower, rather than replace, workers; we increase industries’ resilience and make it more sustainable.
- Greening the economy will require that industry takes a strong leadership role. Industry 5.0’s environmental goals can be achieved by incorporating new technologies and rethinking the production processes in respect to the environmental impacts.

### Industry 5.0

Adopting Industry 4.0 as a purely profit-driven initiative is increasingly untenable. In a globalized world, a narrow focus on profit fails to account correctly for environmental and societal costs and benefits.

### Industry 5.0 technologies

- Industry 5.0 identifies the following six enabling technologies; 1 - Individualized human-machine interaction technologies that interconnect and combine the strengths of humans and machines. 2 - Bio-inspired technologies and smart materials that allow materials with embedded sensors and enhanced features while being recyclable. 3 - Digital Twins and simulation to model entire systems. 4 - Data transmission, storage, and analysis technologies that are able to handle data and system interoperability. 5 - Artificial Intelligence to detect, for example, causalities in complex, dynamic systems, leading to actionable intelligence. 6 - Technologies for energy efficiency, renewables, storage and autonomy

### Industry 5.0 – Enabling Technologies

- Advanced Cyber Physical Systems
- Smart Additive Manufacturing (SAM)
- Machine Learning
- AI Advanced Algorithms
- 5G Communications
- Advanced Blockchains

### Wireless Connectivity – 5G

- The introduction of 5G into the manufacturing workspace will be potentially huge for Industry 4.0.
- 5G itself is a vast game-changer as it bring huge capacity, bandwidth, low-power consumption and very low latency.
- Up to 10Gbps data rate - > 10 to 100x speed improvement over 4G and 4.5G networks
- 1-millisecond latency
- 1000x bandwidth per unit area
- Up to 100x number of connected devices per unit area (compared with 4G LTE)
- 99.999% availability
- 100% coverage
- 90% reduction in network energy usage
- Up to 10-year battery life for low power IoT device
- Private 5G Networks – Manufacturers can run their own private 5G networks to provide guaranteed spectrum, coverage and security.

### Private 5G Network

A private network is an enterprise-dedicated network that provides communication connections to people or things belonging to a specific enterprise and provides specific services necessary for the business of the enterprise. The enterprise operates its own network and uses it exclusively. Unlike public networks, only allowed people and devices can access this network, and data generated within the enterprise is processed locally only within the enterprise's dedicated network, ensuring high security and data privacy

### Private 5G Networks

### Private 5G Deployment Models

- Two basic types of 5G Private Networks:
- Dedicated, on-premises networks. An enterprise
- deploys a dedicated, on-premises network
- (radio access network and core) that is purpose-built
- for the sole use of a single enterprise. The enterprise
- deploys its own edge computing assets.
- Hybrid networks. The network is based on a
- combination of public mobile network components and
- dedicated on-premises elements. For example, a slice of the public radio network may be combined with a dedicated on-premises core network.
- Spectrum. There are four main types of spectrum,
- Industrial spectrum.
- Shared spectrum.
- Public spectrum. This approach uses a mobile network operator’s public network spectrum to support enterprises. Operators lease their spectrum to enterprises for a fee.
- Unlicensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands are designated by regulators, are non-exclusive and free-to-use, but are are making 6GHz licence-exempt spectrum available for 5G and Wi-Fi use in some countries (such as the USA).

### Private 5G Networks: Organizations

- Why are organizations using private LTE/5G networks?
- The demand-side factors for private LTE/5G networks include the following:
- Operational efficiency. The demand for private LTE/5G networks is growing because large organizations' digital transformation programs are underway. Enterprises are in the process of digitizing their data and using it to drive processes and create new digital products and services.
- IT and OT convergence. The convergence of IT and OT is also a key consideration. Ultimately, the need for high-bandwidth, low-latency networks to support increased automation will grow as enterprise data processing requirements increase.
- Data privacy. Enterprises deploy private networks because data privacy is a key concern. They require more control and visibility of their data.
- Cable substitution. Enterprises deploy private LTE/5G networks to support new applications as a more cost-effective alternative to extending their fixed networks.
- Replacing legacy networks. Existing networks such as TETRA are reaching the end of their life and cellular technologies offer viable alternatives.
- Wi-Fi limitations. Enterprises have used Wi-Fi successfully but have found that it has limitations in terms of supporting mobility and/or other factors such as reliability.
